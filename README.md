# Types of Drive Interfaces

Hard drives and optical drives are manufactured with different interfaces that are used to connect the drive to the computer. To install a storage drive in a computer, the connection interface on the drive must be the same as the controller on the motherboard. Here are some common drive interfaces:

# IDE – 
Integrated Drive Electronics, also called Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) is an early drive controller interface that connects computers and hard disk drives. An IDE interface uses a 40-pin connector.

# SATA 
– Serial ATA refers to the serial version of the ATA drive controller interface. A SATA interface uses a 7-pin data connector.
#	SCSI – 
Small Computer System Interface is a drive controller interface that can connect up to 15 drives. SCSI can connect both internal and external drives. An SCSI interface uses a 50-pin, 68-pin, or 80-pin connector.

# TECHNICAL TERMS


•	Bit - a fundamental unit of information having just two possible values, as either of the
binary digits 0 or 1.
•	Byte - a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that most
commonly consists of eight bits.
•	Booting – starting (a computer) by loading an operating system from a disk.
•	Electronic storage - a device for recording (storing) information (data).
•	Firewire - Apple Computer's version of a standard, IEEE 1394, High Performance Serial
Bus, for connecting devices to your personal computer.
•	Hot-swappable - the connection and disconnection of peripherals or other components
without interrupting system operation.
•	Interface - the point of interaction or communication between a computer and any other
entity, such as a printer or human operator.
•	Laser - a device that emits light (electromagnetic radiation) through a process of optical
amplification based on the stimulated emission of photons.
•	Magnetic platter - a thin, high precision disk that is coated on both sides with a high
precision magnetic material and which is used in a hard disk drive
(HDD) to store data.
•	Memory module - a narrow printed circuit board that holds memory chips.
•	Magnetic storage media - any storage medium in which different patterns of magnetization
are used to represent stored bits or bytes of information
•	Operating system - a set of programs that manage computer hardware resources and
provide common services for application software.
•	Optical storage media - any storage in which data is written and read with a laser for
archival or backup purposes.
•	HDD – hard disk drive
•	IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics

• Binay
